## Overview

This example is a very simple multi-service HTTP application
deployed across Kubernetes clusters using Skupper.

It contains two services:

* A backend service that exposes an `/api/hello` endpoint.  It
  returns greetings of the form `Hi, <your-name>.  I am <my-name>
  (<pod-name>)`.

* A frontend service that sends greetings to the backend and
  fetches new greetings in response.

With Skupper, you can place the backend in one cluster and the
frontend in another and maintain connectivity between the two
services without exposing the backend to the public internet.

## Prerequisites

* The `kubectl` command-line tool, version 1.15 or later
  ([installation guide][install-kubectl])

* Access to at least one Kubernetes cluster, from [any provider you
  choose][kube-providers]

[install-kubectl]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/
[kube-providers]: https://skupper.io/start/kubernetes.html

## Step 1: Set up your clusters

Skupper is designed for use with multiple Kubernetes clusters.
The `skupper` and `kubectl` commands use your
[kubeconfig][kubeconfig] and current context to select the cluster
and namespace where they operate.

[kubeconfig]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/

Your kubeconfig is stored in a file in your home directory.  The
`skupper` and `kubectl` commands use the `KUBECONFIG` environment
variable to locate it.

A single kubeconfig supports only one active context per user.
Since you will be using multiple contexts at once in this
exercise, you need to create distinct kubeconfigs.

For each namespace, open a new terminal window.  In each terminal,
set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to a different path and
log in to your cluster.  Then create the namespace you wish to use
and set the namespace on your current context.

**Note:** The login procedure varies by provider.  See the
documentation for yours:

* [Minikube](https://skupper.io/start/minikube.html#cluster-access)
* [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://skupper.io/start/eks.html#cluster-access)
* [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://skupper.io/start/aks.html#cluster-access)
* [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://skupper.io/start/gke.html#cluster-access)
* [IBM Kubernetes Service](https://skupper.io/start/ibmks.html#cluster-access)
* [OpenShift](https://skupper.io/start/openshift.html#cluster-access)

_**West:**_

~~~ shell
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config-west
# Enter your provider-specific login command
kubectl create namespace west
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace west
~~~

_**East:**_

~~~ shell
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config-east
# Enter your provider-specific login command
kubectl create namespace east
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace east
~~~

## Step 2: Deploy the frontend and backend

This example runs the frontend and the backend in separate
Kubernetes namespaces, on different clusters.

Use `kubectl create deployment` to deploy the frontend in West
and the backend in East.

_**West:**_

~~~ shell
kubectl create deployment frontend --image quay.io/skupper/hello-world-frontend
~~~

_**East:**_

~~~ shell
kubectl create deployment backend --image quay.io/skupper/hello-world-backend --replicas 3
~~~

## Step 3: Install Skupper on your clusters

Using Skupper on Kubernetes requires the installation of the
Skupper custom resource definitions (CRDs) and the Skupper
controller.

For each cluster, use `kubectl apply` with the Skupper
installation YAML to install the CRDs and controller.

_**West:**_

~~~ shell
kubectl apply -f https://skupper.io/v2/install.yaml
~~~

_**East:**_

~~~ shell
kubectl apply -f https://skupper.io/v2/install.yaml
~~~

## Step 4: Install the Skupper command-line tool

This example uses the Skupper command-line tool to create Skupper
resources.  You need to install the `skupper` command only once
for each development environment.

On Linux or Mac, you can use the install script (inspect it
[here][install-script]) to download and extract the command:

~~~ shell
curl https://skupper.io/install.sh | sh -s -- --version 2.0.0-preview-1
~~~

The script installs the command under your home directory.  It
prompts you to add the command to your path if necessary.

For Windows and other installation options, see [Installing
Skupper][install-docs].

[install-script]: https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper-website/blob/main/input/install.sh
[install-docs]: https://skupper.io/install/

## Step 5: Create your sites

A Skupper _site_ is a location where components of your
application are running.  Sites are linked together to form a
network for your application.  In Kubernetes, a site is associated
with a namespace.

For each namespace, use `skupper site create` with a site name of
your choice.  This creates the site resource and deploys the
Skupper router to the namespace.

**Note:** If you are using Minikube, you need to [start minikube
tunnel][minikube-tunnel] before you run `skupper init`.

<!-- XXX Explain enabling link acesss on one of the sites -->

[minikube-tunnel]: https://skupper.io/start/minikube.html#running-minikube-tunnel

_**West:**_

~~~ shell
skupper site create west --enable-link-access
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready site/west  # Required with preview 1 - to be removed!
~~~

_Sample output:_

~~~ console
$ skupper site create west --enable-link-access
Waiting for status...
Site "west" is configured. Check the status to see when it is ready

$ kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready site/west  # Required with preview 1 - to be removed!
site.skupper.io/west condition met
~~~

_**East:**_

~~~ shell
skupper site create east
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready site/east  # Required with preview 1 - to be removed!
~~~

_Sample output:_

~~~ console
$ skupper site create east
Waiting for status...
Site "east" is configured. Check the status to see when it is ready

$ kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready site/east  # Required with preview 1 - to be removed!
site.skupper.io/east condition met
~~~

You can use `skupper site status` at any time to check the status
of your site.

## Step 6: Link your sites

A Skupper _link_ is a channel for communication between two sites.
Links serve as a transport for application connections and
requests.

Creating a link requires use of two Skupper commands in
conjunction, `skupper token issue` and `skupper token redeem`.

The `skupper token issue` command generates a secret token that
signifies permission to create a link.  The token also carries the
link details.  Then, in a remote site, The `skupper token redeem`
command uses the token to create a link to the site that generated
it.

**Note:** The link token is truly a *secret*.  Anyone who has the
token can link to your site.  Make sure that only those you trust
have access to it.

First, use `skupper token issue` in West to generate the token.
Then, use `skupper token redeem` in East to link the sites.

_**West:**_

~~~ shell
skupper token issue ~/token.yaml
~~~

_Sample output:_

~~~ console
$ skupper token issue ~/token.yaml
Waiting for token status ...

Grant "west-cad4f72d-2917-49b9-ab66-cdaca4d6cf9c" is ready
Token file /run/user/1000/skewer/token.yaml created

Transfer this file to a remote site. At the remote site,
create a link to this site using the "skupper token redeem" command:

	skupper token redeem <file>

The token expires after 1 use(s) or after 15m0s.
~~~

_**East:**_

~~~ shell
skupper token redeem ~/token.yaml
~~~

_Sample output:_

~~~ console
$ skupper token redeem ~/token.yaml
Waiting for token status ...
Token "west-cad4f72d-2917-49b9-ab66-cdaca4d6cf9c" has been redeemed
You can now safely delete /run/user/1000/skewer/token.yaml
~~~

If your terminal sessions are on different machines, you may need
to use `scp` or a similar tool to transfer the token securely.  By
default, tokens expire after a single use or 15 minutes after
creation.

## Step 7: Expose the backend

We now have our sites linked to form a Skupper network, but no
services are exposed on it.

Skupper uses _listeners_ and _connectors_ to expose services.  A
listener is a local endpoint for client connections, configured
with a routing key.  A connector exists in a remote site and binds
a routing key to a particular set of servers.  Skupper routers
forward client connections from local listeners to remote
connectors with matching routing keys.

In West, use the `skupper listener create` command to create a
listener for the backend.  In East, use the `skupper connector
create` command to create a matching connector.

_**West:**_

~~~ shell
skupper listener create backend 8080
~~~

_Sample output:_

~~~ console
$ skupper listener create backend 8080
Waiting for create to complete...
Listener "backend" is ready
~~~

_**East:**_

~~~ shell
skupper connector create backend 8080
~~~

_Sample output:_

~~~ console
$ skupper connector create backend 8080
Waiting for create to complete...
Connector "backend" is ready
~~~

The commands shown above use the name argument, `backend`, to set
the default routing key and pod selector.  You can use the
`--routing-key` and `--selector` options to specify other values.

## Step 8: Access the frontend

In order to use and test the application, we need external access
to the frontend.

Use `kubectl port-forward` to make the frontend available at
`localhost:8080`.

_**West:**_

~~~ shell
kubectl port-forward deployment/frontend 8080:8080
~~~

You can now access the web interface by navigating to
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Summary

This example locates the frontend and backend services in different
namespaces, on different clusters.  Ordinarily, this means that they
have no way to communicate unless they are exposed to the public
internet.

Introducing Skupper into each namespace allows us to create a virtual
application network that can connect services in different clusters.
Any service exposed on the application network is represented as a
local service in all of the linked namespaces.

The backend service is located in `east`, but the frontend service
in `west` can "see" it as if it were local.  When the frontend
sends a request to the backend, Skupper forwards the request to the
namespace where the backend is running and routes the response back to
the frontend.
